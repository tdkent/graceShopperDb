      "This is, as virtually everyone knows, a classic for the ages; but this Penguin edition has some excellent notes that bring the writing to life. One I remember offhand is a description of how, in England of the time, the cultivation of a garden was a moral undertaking -- that is, your garden should reflect a respect for the randomness of nature as well as provide beauty. Other excellent notes described how these folks ate -- nothing until 10, then a huge breakfast, then dinner in the late afternoon, and after music and games, supper. Also, the book is written and spelled as Austen spelled, so for example, 'choose is spelt 'chuse' (and spelled is spelled spelt). Not everyone will be charmed by this, but it brought the much-loved and oft-read book to life for me in a new way.",

    content: "I picked up this book largely due to fond memories of  Pride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics) , but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along."

  {
    content: "As long as you don't want any footnotes, summaries or explaination about terms or references that most folks don't use today. The book is simple straightforward and you don't have all the filler pages like ya have with some classics you buy today taking up half the book size. Just the novel itself."

    content: "As I am not a native English speaker, I struggled with the language of two centuries ago. However I've enjoyed the story, the scenes, the landscapes, the characters. Jane Austen's novels are superb. And the end of Mansfield Park is at the same time unpredictable but evident. It is a lovely story."

  {
    content: "A classic for sure. Be aware however, that this particular book has very small print!"
